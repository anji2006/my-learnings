/*
    ==>> What is an Operating System??
        * As OS is software Programming Which is act as intermidiatory between Hardware and Application or Software programs Running On it.
        * It Will Take care about Hardware Management 
            - This Incluedes CPU, Memory, storage Devices(hard drives, solid-state drives), 
            - input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, display) and Network Components.
        * Process Management
            - It will Take care of Individual Process or Task
            - It allocates CPU time, manages process scheduling, 
            - coordinates communication between processes.
        * Security and Access Control:
            -  It manages user accounts, permissions, and authentication, 
            - ensuring that only authorized users can access certain files or perform specific actions.
        * Networking:
            -It will Allow the user to access remote resources, sharing files and use Network service.

    1) Multiplty Process?
        * Multiplty Process doesn't mean multiple Processers.
        * It means multiple "Processes".
        * Processes are Task or Computations.
        * Processors are Machines also Know as CPU (Central Processing Unit).

*/

/*
    2) CPU or Processors ?
        * It is a Silicon Chip which is usally do the computational Tasks.
        * Every CPU may Have Cors.
        * Now In this arayy We are Using "Multi core Processings"

    ===> Process Life Cycle ?
        1) New Task
        2) Ready To Run (Not Running)
            -Task Will be in Ready Queue
            -Scheduling The Time To Execute The Task
        3) Running (Process Being Executed).
            - Task is being Executed By the CPU
            * "I/O Event" Can Be Happen in this state (showing on Screen / taking inputs from keyboard or mouse)
            * In The I/O Event is happening The task is been in Waiting Queue
            1) Waiting Queue as the process is in I/O Event.
            2) CPU May Intrupt the process after some time.
            3) Process will be in "Ready To Run and in Ready Queue "
                - After that It will be ready to execute again.
        4) Process Will Exit Or Terminate.(Basically Completes the Task)

/*
    ===> What is the CPU Speed ?
        * It will be Based on Two Things 1) Clock Frequency 2) Flops
        * Clock Frequency
            ---> It will measures in 1/sec or Hz how many operations It can do per sec.
            ----> Ex:--  2.3 GHz
        * Flops
            ---> floating point operation per sec
        * Registers Takes 0.1 ns (nano sec) to read
        * RAM Takes nearly 100 ns (nano sec) to read
        * DISC Takes nearly 10 ms (milly sec) to read
