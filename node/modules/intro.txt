in Node JS, each JavaScript file is treated as a seperate module.

1) Built-in Core Modules.
    --> this doesn't required additional installations.
    --> these are part of Node JS Core.
    --> Ex :-- http , fs(file System) , path , os , util

2) local Modules.
    --> these are created by devloper or user.
    --> It is a file which is having JS functions, Objects, or arrays any 
            kind of code that can be imported using "require()".

3) NPM (Node packages Manager)
    --> NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, 
    --> To use an NPM module, you typically need to install it using npm install

4) ES-6 Modules
    --> new features to import and export a code from module
    --> import name from "./module-path"
    --> export varible (which having some code related to JS)
    --> export default varible (to export a default JS code)
    --> for using ES6 module syntax the extension (.mjs) Ex:-- filename.mjs 
        (or) set  "type" : "module" in the package.json that indicates your project using ES6 syntax.
