#!/bin/bash
# The first line of your shell script should start with a "shebang" 
# (#,!) 
# followed by the path to the shell that will execute the script. In this case, we use 
#  /bin/bash to specify that the Bash shell should be used.

echo "Hello, World!"

# echo is used to print in the console
echo "hiii Pottiii, How are you!"




Task 
    Automation: #Shell scripts are used to automate tasks and processes, 
        #reducing the need for manual intervention. This includes tasks like file operations, data processing, backups, and system maintenance.

System Administration: Shell scripts are widely used by system administrators to manage and configure servers, install software packages, monitor system resources, and perform system maintenance tasks.

Text Processing and Parsing: Shell scripting provides powerful text processing capabilities using tools like grep, sed, awk, and regular expressions. These tools are often combined in scripts to process and extract data from text files, log files, or system output.

Report Generation: Shell scripts can collect and process data from various sources to generate reports, summary files, and logs for system monitoring, auditing, and debugging purposes.

Batch Processing: Shell scripts are used for batch processing, where a series of commands and operations are executed sequentially without user interaction. This is useful for repetitive tasks and running scheduled jobs.

Server Configuration: Shell scripts are used to set up and configure servers, networks, and services to ensure consistency and reduce manual configuration errors.

Deployment and CI/CD: In DevOps workflows, shell scripts are often used for deployment scripts and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

Backup and Restore: Shell scripts are used for creating backup scripts that automate the process of backing up critical data and files, as well as restoring them when needed.

Log Analysis: Shell scripts can be used to parse and analyze log files, identify errors, and generate reports or alerts based on log data.

Interactive Utilities: Shell scripts can create interactive command-line utilities that prompt users for input and perform various operations based on the input.

Managing Cron Jobs: Shell scripts are used to manage and automate cron jobs, which are scheduled tasks that run at specified intervals.

Overall, shell scripting is a versatile and powerful tool for automating various tasks, managing systems, and handling text-based data in a Unix/Linux environment. Its simplicity and availability on most Unix-based systems make it an accessible choice for system administrators, developers, and anyone who needs to perform automation and scripting tasks in a command-line environment.
